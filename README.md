# Machine-Learning-for-Customer-Grouping-in-RStudio

 
# Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial application of unsupervised learning, allowing businesses to identify distinct customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this project, we use K-means clustering, a fundamental algorithm for clustering unlabeled datasets, to segment customers based on their characteristics.
